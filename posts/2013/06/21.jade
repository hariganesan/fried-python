<p> Wow, it's been a pretty crazy week. Microsoft went back on its DRM policy, the Heat won the finals, I <i>finally</i> finished POP:WW, and I've now entered my blog posts into a database!

<p> It's actually pretty cool. I've only worked on front-end web development, so I decided to take a little journey into the mysteries of SQL and PHP. Turns out, given the right interface (in my case, phpMyAdmin), I pretty much wasted my time reading through this SQL book I bought online. While it's great that I now know SQL, phpMyAdmin pretty much does all of the gruntwork for me, and the only SQL I really need is actually within the PHP on the actual website when I want to serve up the page for the user using data from the database. Web URLs make so much more sense now!

<p> The dillemma I'm now facing is that Node.js doesn't support PHP. Therefore, if I want to continue using Node for my blog, whatever calls I make to the MySQL database will have be set up through some sort of Express server which pushes it to Jade beforehand. It seems like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6914990/retrieving-all-the-content-of-a-mysql-query-to-jade-template-engine-through-node?rq=1">a little bit of server code</a>, but not too bad on the whole... could be my next project!
