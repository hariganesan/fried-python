<p> It's been a while! Went to Montreal over July 4th weekend; it was pretty nice. Saw some really good jazz, managed to avoid poutine, and walked around for a while in the underground city, which is pretty ridiculous. 2,000 stores? 200 entrance points? Talk about a labrynth... </p>

<p> Speaking of mazes, I've been trying to get through Persona 4 lately. It's pretty much the same game as Persona 3 in the big scheme of JRPGs, but there are quite a few differences. Personally, I liked P3 more - the soundtrack was better, the characters were better (android versus teddy bear? I'll take the android), and the overall atmosphere of the game is more to my liking; P3 was more serious, dark, and mysterious, whereas P4 is lighter, happier, and more colorful. I mean, the dark hour versus getting sucked into a TV? The choice was obvious to me. </p>

<p> It is true that I mostly like P3 better from a design standpoint. As far as the actual gameplay, there are a number of things that I like more about P4. The best is that they got rid of the "health statuses" - no more dealing with tired party members! Instead, your SP doesn't regenerate when you return to the home base area in the dungeon. You can pay a fee to get it refilled, but it's really only worth it later in the game. In battle, the devs added follow-up attacks and allowed for you to directly control other characters. They combined all physical attacks into one type, and improved the scan feature. They also did a good job integrating the square button into the game for teleporting and providing descriptions of skills. These changes may make the gameplay better on the whole, but they don't make me more interested in actually playing the game. I guess it's the same critique I have of <i>Skyword Sword</i> over <i>Twilight Princess</i> - true, the game was much better, but I definitely preferred the whole mood of TP (the art, plot, etc.). </p>

<p> Well, one thing I can definitely say: it's still much better than <i>The Answer</i>, the extra part of P3:FES. That grinding marathon was a gigantic waste of my time. </p>
