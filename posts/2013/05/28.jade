	<p> Happy Tuesday! So I'd like to take this opportunity to talk a little about memory. About a week ago, I finished reading Joshua Foer's <i>Moonwalking With Einstein</i>. In the book, Foer discusses several methods that allow a person with an average memory (like me) to be able to remember important information by using the best kinds of associations. That is, by predicting the types of associations that will allow an image to stick in my memory, I can better remember these images.

	<p> Computer memory can work in a similar fashion. In most systems, there is some sort of memory hierarchy, which is based on what the system to predict what part of the system will be accessed next. This data is usually stored in some sort of memory which is easy to access but limited by the hardware of the system. Let's take a game with a complex graphics system as an example. The game will usually only render the parts which are only going to be accessible to the user in the near future, and that takes some kind of prediction. The better these predictions, the less likely for cache misses, and the game to lag as a result (and no one likes lag!). 

	<p class="small"> Speaking of RAM... Daft Punk's new album is pretty good, but I still like Discovery better. :)

	<p> Last week was also the supposedly exciting reveal of Microsoft's new console - confirmed as the "XBOX One". Except... it <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/23/ign-poll-result-75-disappointed-with-xbox-one-reveal">wasn't that exciting</a>. E3 is coming up soon, so we'll know more details soon, since looking at <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_vs._Wii_U_Comparison_Chart">what we do know</a> about both Microsoft and Sony's consoles, it's unclear which has the upper hand in terms of hardware. More importantly though, will be their final take on <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-18438_7-57585778-82/game-over-for-used-games-how-xbox-one-and-ps4-could-gut-gamers-wallets/">used games</a>. This would be the biggest issue for me, considering I <i>still</i> buy used PS2 games and play them in my spare time. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Your move, Sony!
