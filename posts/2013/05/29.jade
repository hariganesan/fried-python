	<p> I've made a few stylistic changes to the site, and I added a favicon, picture, and a video! WHOO MEDIA.

	<p> Anyway, I was watching a game show this morning called "Let's Make A Deal". On the show, a contestant was given a bunch of cards (I believe it was around ten) in a row facing away from him. He was then told that if a card was flipped over and had a Joker on it, which was on only one of the cards, the game was over (he would get $0), but if it was any other card, he would get $500 added to his sum. He was given an option of flipping over the cards left-to-right or vice-versa, as well as the option to leave the game after the flipping over of each card. Mathematically, this is an interesting game - if we assume the chance of the Joker being any one of the cards is equal.

	<p> Of course, each person has a marginal willingness to play (haha) based on how much the money is worth to them, but let's ignore that, and assume that the player only wants to maximize his expected payoff (or utility). We can calculate his EU via an inductive argument: if he's already flipped over <i>i</i> cards, and there is a less than 1-in-<i>i+1</i> chance that the next card is the Joker, he should flip it over. A quick example: he's already flipped over 2 cards, so if there is a less than 1-in-3 chance that the next card is a Joker, he will flip it over, since the EU must be higher than from quitting (which would be $1000), and the average would be >= ($1500+$1500+0)/3. Meaning, for <i>n</i> cards, we would want to stop after a possible <i>n/2</i> flips. Game Theory FTW!

	<p> We could also assume an sort of all-or-nothing mentality: The player can only have an expected payoff of either 0 or 1, depending on whether or not he can get money each time. In other words, when the chances are at least 50% that a certain card will NOT be the joker, the player continues. But this brings about quite a paradox: the player would choose to play at each step of the game until the very end, considering that there is a much better chance that one of the other cards has a Joker than the one he is about to flip over. Doesn't that seem... weird? The reason is because the only situation in which the player could win is if he picks all of the cards <i>until</i> the Joker, and the probability of that is just 1/n, the same probability that the Joker is the last card.
