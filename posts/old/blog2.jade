	p <b><i>PHIL</i> - Am I the only actor?</b> This is as relevant as most things are in philosophy - as much as you think it is. So let's suppose that I am the only actor in the world. This assumption has several consequential questions, the biggest which could be: Is everything and everyone else random or decided? To take it one step further, let's suppose that there are only two actors in the world. Would it matter? Could it be the same? These questions are dependent on whether or not you would believe the world is a connected graph. The butterfly or domino effect can only be achieved by nodes which are adjacent to one another; so could there be a closed loop? I would like to believe that technically there isn't, for the reason that every molecule has probably interacted with every other molecule by some n-degree of separation, but that for all practical purposes (or lack thereof?) that there could be some randos who live in the middle of the woods and no one knows about them, or everyone forgot about them or something. Anyway, assuming that there are closed loops, then we can suppose that there would be a number of actors possible without having any interacting actors. In other words, if that number were the world's population, then it would be quite the paradox - everyone would be an actor, but no one would be interacting with - or perhaps a better word would be influencing - each other.
	p To make things even more interesting, we could ask ourselves whether a single person is always the same actor over time; that is, should personal identity be preserved. So, should I be several actors over time, then what implications does that have on our situation? Or on life in general? You could say that talking to yourself is interacting with another actor just milliseconds different from you. Taking notes is just more of an extreme; it's like part of a conversation you have with your future self when you take them and with your past self when you read them. Now I begin to wonder - people who write in diaries or give themselves reminders - are they changing more rapidly then everyone else, such that they require these time-self interactions? Or perhaps it's just a good habit...
	p One last question: Would it be better if I were the only actor or the only non-actor? The answer seems obvious - as the actor. However, as the only actor, I would probably feel alone and trapped. The fact that everything around me is already decided and predictable - the sense of "power" that I would have would surely be diminished. However, as the only non-actor, I don't think that my perspective would change more than marginally. People would be able to predict me, but the way that I would interact with everyone else would be the same. It wouldn't matter to me that my actions were predestined because I wouldn't know them. I guess we might as well all be machines, right?
	p.small Whenever I meet someone I really like, I'm always hoping he or she is an actor rather than a non-actor. Seems like a moot point...
