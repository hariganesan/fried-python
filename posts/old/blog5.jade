	p <b><i>TECH</i> - Why Wikipedia?</b> I was not at all surprised to find that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/28/study-finds-most-teachers-use-wikipedia-are-hypocrites/"> a majority of teachers reject the validity of Wikipedia yet use it for their classes</a>. The truth is, I would call Wikipedia the MOST reliable source on a variety of topics. It really depends on how important or popular the topic is. If you told me that the page on the United States or on Philosophy weren't accurate, I would be extremely surprised. The simple fact of the matter is this: would you trust the couple of people who might have created that one entry in Encyclopedia Britannica, or the hundreds of people who have edited and re-edited the same entry in Wikipedia? I will always take the combined worth of hundreds of amateurs and professionals over a few professionals.

	p I think that part of the problem is that most historians and educators do not quite understand the entirety of the checks and balances that Wikipedia enacts throughout its articles. If you ever were wandering around Youtube comments, and wanted to find some more elaborate but still <a href="http://xkcd.com/1167/">meaningless arguments</a>, you might want to stumble around on Wikipedia talk pages, articles for deletion, and requests for administratorship If you're really begging for some literary complexity, browse Wikipedia's policies. I would even say that the majority of people who regularly edit Wikipedia are quite aware of these policies, because if you make an edit that doesn't fit or create a page that isn't relevant, chances are that your edit will go away. And then if you make a lot of edits and actually try to fit them in, you still will encounter opposition to your edits. And then you'll wander around the policies to see what other people are referring to in order to not have your edits <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail35.html">a-deleted</a>. 

	p It gets more complex. There are a series of people who frequent the Recent Changes page on Wikipedia and "roll back" changes. And they program bots to monitor these pages and edit out lewd and inappropriate material. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see bots being the new editors of Wikipedia. Who better to create unbiased material than a robot? After all, there are certain structures which are inherently apparent on any Wikipedia page; for example, there might be a particular default table of contents depending on the topic, the first link is almost always some superset of the current topic (which always leads to Philosophy?), often there are certain images and other media which are present on the same kinds of pages, and these different types of pages are categorized. If I were an expert Wikipedia racer, I might have a better sense of the structure of any particular page.

	p Of course, it goes without saying that Wikipedia still has its many flaws. If you looked up really specific or obscure material, it may not be as well written, sourced, and even correct sometimes. After all, ANYONE can edit it. I really think that you should at least log in to make edits, but I suppose that goes against the fundamental basis of the website.
