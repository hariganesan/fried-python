	p <b><i>PSYC</i> - How effective is advertising?</b> Apparently, the average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad this last year was $4 million. That's... a lot of money. In fact, this was the first year I can remember that there were <i>ads for ads</i>. Have you ever wondered how people decide which ads work and which ones don't? I can imagine a team of marketing experts come together and try and decide what the next big hit will be - but it's probably the lone psychologist in the room that really has the upper hand. After countless test-cases, what grabs our attention the most? I've always found a common relationship between memory and effective advertising - and that the most lewd or bizarre material to be the easiest to remember. This would create an odd situation - that the advertising that was most <i>unlike</i> other advertising would be the most effective because it would draw your attention. But if everyone is trying to do that, then what is the norm and what is being "out of the box"? It could be commercials that often have nothing to do with the product specified (Geico). But what about those which are trying to "get into your head"? Like commercials that always have a catch phrase or tune (Mcdonalds), or a certain recurring motif (Coke, polar bears). Obviously, there are lots of things I haven't discussed - most of which I have little to no expertise - that these big brands take into effect before airing a $4 million ad. But the root of these remain in the field of psychology and behavioral studies. What I have trouble understanding is how a company can judge the effectiveness of a certain type of advertising. There are so many other factors that would affect a company's revenue; are controlled experiments really possible? Can these companies run effective control groups and effectively monitor people's behavior? I guess I would be interested in the specific studies for which advertisers base their decisions on - how well are they run? What do advertisers find as the most important criteria for making an advert? And then, how does that change with rebranding, and with new competition, and the changing of the general attitudes of the populous?

	p Online advertising is much easier to judge. Every time you click on an advert, and whether or not you've clicked on it twice, and whether or not it was a Monday, or at 4 am, and whether or not you're in the middle of sub-saharan Africa - all of this data is easily accessible and gets automatically factored into the next advert. Websites often partner up with middleman ad networks to help with price discrimination - to help make sure that you, in particular, are being targeted with the ads that you would most likely pick. In contrast, who in the world is watching the TV in your grandma's house? How come she gets bombarded with ads for sketchers? Online TV already has much more audience-specific targeting. Maybe, as TV evolves, you would have to input information about yourself to get more personal adverts. After all, it's better for you and for the advertising company. I'm sick of watching commercials for the scooter store.
