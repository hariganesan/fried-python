	p <b><i>PSYC</i> - What is the most personality-honing binary question?</b> This is a tough question, and I realize that there is ample speculation as to what one might mean by "learning more personality". It would be difficult to come up with a standardized system of items by which to associate someone - and to be able to weigh them equally. However, let's assume that some standardized system exists, and that we could say that we would be able to more fully identify one's habits, customs, and beliefs by asking a series of yes or no questions to them (with some interpreter, perhaps, for other languages). Let's also assume that our individual is a) able to understand and answer the question and b) is telling the truth.

	p So, what would be the one question that I could ask someone in order to understand the most about a person? If we're only limiting ourselves to the entire world, the most obvious one seems to be the sex divide: "Are you male (or female)?" There doesn't seem to be a good racial divide, since the most we could probably ascertain is if someone was from a developed country or if they were a certain skin tone. Which, we could still pose as a binary question: "Are you from a country with a life expectancy of over ____", where the blank would be the median of the world's population. Or maybe one's age tells us the most, so it would be "Are you ____ years old", where the blank would be the median age of the world. Some more: "Does your city/town/village have more than ____ inhabitants" or "Do you have more than ____ people in your family?"

	p The real problem is, of course, there is no standardized system, and it would be extremely difficult to make one. People who favor certain facts about a person would be biased towards those. Artists would ask "Is your favorite color warm (or cool)", religious zealots would ask "Do you believe in one God", and doctors might ask "Are your parents dead" or "Do you have a child". There are also some rather interesting divisions, like "Do you wear some sort of shoes" or "Do you eat rice everyday" or "Can you access the internet". We can actually look up the percentages of some of these questions - 60% of the world have footwear, 35% have some access to the internet, around 50% are monotheist, 60% are lactose intolerant, 45% speak some Indo-European language, and somewhere between 40 and 50% of the world eat rice every day. While these questions might make for a good split of the world, they do not necessarily tell us more <i>about</i> someone, which is still left up to whoever is asking the question. Now, if we limited ourselves to highly developed countries, the splits are not as evident. But instead of finding ways to divide ourselves, maybe I should be focusing on that which unites us?
