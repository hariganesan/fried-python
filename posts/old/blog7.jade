	p <b><i>ECON</i> - Why are brackets inefficient?</b> No, I'm not talking about [these]. I'm talking about tournament brackets, from professional tennis to march madness. Usually, previous play will somehow dictate a ranking or seeding, whether it be by a regular season record or a coaches poll. Then, come playoff time, or Wimbledon or whatever, the highest seeds will be pittest against the lowest seeds. And therein lies the problem: sometimes, lower seeds will often be better than higher seeds. What's more important is that higher seeds might rather play a higher seed than a lower seed. And this is why brackets should change.

	p Of course, you need some measure of determining fair rankings. I personally think for team sports, coaches polls make more sense, since a team's record is often not a good reflection of their current state, depending on how much better or worse they have gotten over the course of that record (maybe games which are played later in the year should carry more weight?). But I'm actually okay with records, for at least the better seeded half of the teams in the tourney. Or, better yet, the better seeded half of teams in each <i>round</i> of the tourney. Each team, from the best down, should then have a choice in deciding who they play each round. It's that simple. 

	p The current system can lead to some rather strange incentives. Supposing team A has the top seed with a couple games left of the regular season, and it's only a game ahead of team B. Now, there are two other teams, teams Y and Z, which will be the last two to make it into the tournament, and their seeds are set. While team Y may have a better record, both teams A and B would rather not play team Z because of a variety of probable causes: a player came back from an injury recently, they've historically done much better in the playoffs rather than the regular season, or maybe team A or B simply has a better past record against team Y. So, in an effort to make their playoff run much easier, both team A and team B begin sitting players and throwing games. What if they ended up playing each other? (We could also set up the same situation for teams Y and Z.)

	p Now, can we think of any way this might backfire? I suppose you could say, "Hey, but then if you're the team that's picked as last (to play the first seed), wouldn't that give you more of an incentive to do well?" Well, this is certainly possible, but unlikely. There would probably be some expected heirarchy of teams for which the higher seeded teams would make their decisions. They could also just explain their reasoning, given some past history or some particular advantage they have over the other team. At least this way, no team would be able to say at the end "Oh, but our road to the finals was so much harder than yours" - well then they should have picked differently.
